stepone
=======

Step One's goal is to finalize the prototype arduino software.
Control 3 stepper motors with phase shit drivers vs step/direction drivers.
Program must incude a simple gui to control x/y pixel size and x/y number of pixles.
The arduino must also write an entry into a log file when step command is sent loging the unix time and current x/y location
